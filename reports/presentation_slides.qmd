## Typical project flow

-   Initialize Git on a folder, making it a **Repository (or Repo)**

-   Work on your project! Change, add, or delete project files -- these are now considered **Modified**

-   Select the **Modified** files you want to **Stage**

-   **Staged** files are **Committed**, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files

-   When you're ready to integrate your changes into the main project, **Push** your **Committed** changes to the **Main Repository**
